jdk should be installed
apache maven should be installed

open a cmd in the folder of the pom.xml and type:

mvn clean install

this will execute the following build phases:
clean - cleanup
compile - compile java files
test - run tests (if any)
package - generate .jar files
install - register jar file with maven (in case we use it in other projects)
